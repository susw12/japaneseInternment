                        As the years progressed, the textbooks started revealing more of the horrors that happened
                        in Japanese Internment Camps. The word choice of the text turned more negative and started
                        being more direct with the information. Instead of inserted propaganda into the textbook,
                        they began to reveal the truth behind Japanese internment.

                        FDR signed Executive Order 9066 on 2/19/1942 shortly after the bombing of Pearl Harbor.
                        It required the relocation of people with Japanese ancestry because the government feared
                        that Japanese Americans were spies. In order to supervise the activities of Japanese
                        Americans, the War Relocation Authority was set up in March 1942 to administer the plan,
                        with Milton S. Eisenhower, from the Department of Agriculture.

                       In an interview with a Japanese woman who suffered through the time of the internment camps, she stated how 
                      their freedom was suddenly taken away from them by the Americans: “Suddenly we don’t be free”. Most Japanese 
                      people were clueless about their situation, even when they arrived at the camps. After discovering the shocking 
                      truth behind those camps, they desperately wanted a government that was truly “by the people and for the people”.

                    <div class="mdl-card__supporting-text">
                        There were 10 housing camps. All Japanese Americans had to sleep in barracks, eat in a common area, and 
                      shared bathrooms. Each relocation center was its own town, which had schools, postal offices, and other 
                      necessary buildings. Many Japanese Americans worked at net factories, building supplies for the military.

                        Many Japanese Americans were killed for attempting to flee or getting too close to the perimeter. Because 
                      of the frequent killings, riots occurred in almost all the relocation camps. In order to “calm down the crowd”, 
                      American police had to tear-gas crowds, causing some more accidental deaths.

                        Japanese internment camps ended in 1945, and the last camp closed in 1946. In the Endo vs. Us case, the 
                      court ruled that: War Relocation Authority “has no authority to subject citizens who are concededly loyal to 
                      its leave procedure”. Endo was daughter of Japanese immigrants of Sacramento, California. Before even going 
                      to court, Endo filled out a habeas corpus petition, requesting for the camps to be ended.
